# About Ledi

Ledi is an open source menstrual management application built with flutter.
Currently available for Android but the iOS version will be released soon.


## About project
For most girls and women globally, menstruation is an event that they dread the most, yet they have to live with the fact that it will happen monthly all factors constant. Girls globally are still being shamed and ridiculed for being on their periods. Most women have reported being unprepared for their periods and experiencing period-related difficulties.  In cases where you visit a doctor on having reproductive system related illnesses, most people are unable to be helped on time because they have no records of their cycles and they can’t tell what is normal from what is abnormal.


Ledi is a period tracking app for women available on smartphones, both Android and iOS.	This app will enable women to track their symptoms and predict when their next period and PMS will start. Also, they will also be able to know their fertility window. 
Ledi is built with user privacy and security as a priority. As such, no sensitive user information such as health data is sent to the backend. All user health data is stored on their mobile phones so that the user has full control of their data. The only data collected by the developer is the email address.


The application was built using flutter framework (Dart programming language) and Firebase for backend. It uses mobile machine learning to predict key events in a woman’s menstrual cycle.

### Goal
This app will enable women to track the most important period and reproductive symptoms to enable them to lead healthier and well-informed lives.
